Created decisions for the documentation
Decided on how to track the decisions, how to store data, user interaction and data structure
TODO learn more about JSON, get some ideas about which classes to use, write a decision file for
which programming paradigm to use.

Wrote decision file on programming paradigm and classes.
TODO draw some kind of illustration to show how the classes will interact with each other
TODO begin making a simpler version of the app. A simpler version of the app would perhaps be a version
that does not support making files.

### Problems encountered

I struggle with the folder structure.
Python seems to struggle with importing files that does not just contain small letters.
For instance import workout is fine, import workout-session is not.
Neither is DRAFT-workout.

### Lessons learned

I think it would make sense to have three classes rather than two. Exercise, workout session, journal.

### Things to be considered

I should implement tests. Perhaps try a test-driven approach.
