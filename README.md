## Motivation
I want to track my progress in power lifting. The long term goal is to compete in the Norwegian Championship and I need to lift at least `550` kgs in total for deadlift, benchpress and squats.

## Required Capabilties
I need to be able to do two things: 

  1. Write down the results of my workouts, 
  2. Find some way to track my estimated [1RM](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-repetition_maximum). 
  The problem with the second point would be to find out how I can estimate the 1RM in for instance deadlift based on a different repetition range and
  from variations of deadlift, such as trap-bar deadlift, and so on.
