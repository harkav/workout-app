# Data structure for files

## Context and Problem Statement

What should my data look like when it is stored?

What should my data look like in memory?

## Considered Options

Considered using txt, but that could be messy. Thought about webapplication, but I do not
know anything about them. JSON sounds fun. I know next to nothing about that either, but could
be fun to learn.

### Json with some schema

TODO

### Custom format

TODO

## Decision Outcome

JSON
