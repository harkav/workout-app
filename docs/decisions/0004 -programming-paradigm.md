# Which paradigm(s) to use?

## Context and Problem Statement

I need to choose a programming paradigm, or perhaps a combination of several

## Considered Options

I know a little about procedural programming and object oriented programming.
OOP seems like a good choice, since both exercises and workout sessions can be made as
classes.

## Decision Outcome

I do not know any other paradigm than OOP and procedural, so I think I'll go for
a combination of the two with an emphasis on OOP.
