# Use simple MADR for documentation and tracking decisions 

## Comtext amd Problem Statement

I want to track my progress in writing the app and my progress as a developer 
I want to get the feel of how you document your progress as a developer 
I want to track the decisions and how I have thought about creating the app 

## Considered Options

Not doing it ðŸ’¤: It's less work right now and writing documentation is notoriously dull

Using simple MADR: It's a bit of work, but I can look back later and see why I did things if projects stall, and see my own progression in projects over time

## Decision 

I decided to use a simple version of [MADR](https://adr.github.io/madr/)
