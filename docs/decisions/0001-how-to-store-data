# How to store data? 

## Context and problem statement 

I need to register the data from the workouts and be able to load them after the application is finished running 

## Considered options 

Using files - I know how to do this 
Physical prints - Hard to read in again, not considered seriously 
SQL - I know nothing about SQL 

## Decision outcome 

Files should work
